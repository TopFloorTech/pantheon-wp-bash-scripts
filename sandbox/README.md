Demonstrates how to build multiple sites on Pantheon with a script

For educational purposes only

Assumes a CSV exists with 5 columns of data in order listed as they are in script

Replace all values in <> notation before running or it will, of course, fail. 

Also must have an Organiation on Pantheon to use this script due to sandbox limits

Since we are only echoing the commands, you will need to pipe the output into a new file and run that
for example: $ ./buildscriptbuilt.sh > newscripttorun.sh


Note: if you can help me figure out why this times out after the first row of data if you just execute these commands in the loop, let me know
